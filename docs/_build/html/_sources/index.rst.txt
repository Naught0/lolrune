lolrune is a package which contains two clients (async and non-async), through which you can fetch League of Legends rune information for any champion. 

Installation
------------

I *highly* recommend that you install the package in a virtual environment, or with the ``--user`` flag, like so:

On Unix-based OSes

.. code:: bash
    
    $ python3 -m pip install lolrune --user

or on Windows

.. code:: bat
    
    > py -3 -m pip install lolrune --user

The ``--user`` flag ensures that lolrune will be able to write its data to a json file. Otherwise, your scripts will have to be run as admin on *some* systems, and that's lame.

Alternatively, install in a virtual environment by using pipenv_.
